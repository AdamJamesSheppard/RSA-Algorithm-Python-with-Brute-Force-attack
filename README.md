A naive implementation of the RSA algorithm with the aim to describe the maths behind the algorithm.

* uses no built-in functionality except basic arithmetic functions 
* Explains the Mathematics from a Number theoretic perspective 
* easily changed to support larger primes etc 
* open to suggestions for improvements
